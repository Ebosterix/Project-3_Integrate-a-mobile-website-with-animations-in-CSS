# Project-3: Integrating a mobile website with animations in CSS
The Challenge is thus as follows;

A client would like to open their services in the French capital.

My Task:
● Phase 1: Develop a site offering the menu of four great Parisian restaurants.
● Phase 2: Allow online booking and menu composition.

Timeline:
● Delivery date of the first version of the site: within 1 month.
● Delivery date of the second version of the site: within 6 months.

Technologies:
● The development will have to be in CSS, without JavaScript.
● No framework should be used; however, Sass would be a plus.
● No CSS code should be applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag.
