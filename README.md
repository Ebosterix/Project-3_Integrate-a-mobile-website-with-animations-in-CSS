# Oc-project-3: In this project, a client requests that you build them a website to cater for their customers in the food service industry.
The Challenge is thus as follows;

We would like to open our services in the French capital.
● Phase 1: Develop a site offering the menu of four great Parisian restaurants.
● Phase 2: Allow online booking and menu composition.

Operations Budget:$30,000

Timeline:
● Delivery date of the first version of the site: within 1 month.
● Delivery date of the second version of the site: within 6 months.

Technologies:
● The development will have to be in CSS, without JavaScript.
● No framework should be used; however, Sass would be a plus.
● No CSS code should be applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag.
